## Your Web Application Title

your glitch (or alternative server) link e.g. http://a3-wilson-wong.glitch.me

Include a very brief summary of your project here. Images are encouraged, along with concise, high-level text. Be sure to include:

- the goal of the application
- challenges you faced in realizing the application
- what authentication strategy you chose to use and why (choosing one because it seemed the easiest to implement is perfectly acceptable)
- what CSS framework you used and why
  - include any modifications to the CSS framework you made via custom CSS you authored

*Technical*
- (5 points) Instead of Glitch, host your site on a different service like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).
  Make sure to describe this a bit in your README. What was better about using the service you chose as compared to Glitch? 
  What (if anything) was worse? 
- (5 points) Get 100% (not 98%, not 99%, but 100%) in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment.
- (up to 5 points) List up to five Express middleware packages you used and a short (one sentence) summary of what each 
  one does:
	- passport / passport-local: Lets you authenticate users (passport) using a locally defined password authenticator (passport-local).
	- body-parser: Parses incoming fetch request bodies, needed for clean input to passport-local.
	- express-session: Creates a "session" that records specific data for a user that can be accessed by the server at any time.
	- path: Allows for file path manipulation.
